# Contribution Guidelines

This resource is a community effort and wouldn't be possible without you! We appreciate and recognize [all contributors](https://github.com/cloudops/awesome-grub/graphs/contributors).

- **To add, remove, or change items in the list: `Submit a Pull Request`**
- Changes to the content should be made in the `README.md` file.

There are two ways to create a pull request to contribute:
1. Use the editor inside the Github Web UI (the easy way).
    - Select the `README.md` file and then click the **pencil** *(Edit this file)* in the top right of the page.
    - Make your changes, fill in the `Commit changes` section and click the `Commit changes` button.
    - In the background, this will fork the repo to your account and create a pull request including the desired changes.
2. Manually fork the repo and create a pull request (the developers way).
    - In the top right of the screen, click the `Fork` button, which will fork the repo to your personal Github account.
    - Once forked, `clone` your forked repository down to your local machine.
    - Make edits locally and then `push` your changes to your forked repo.
    - Click the new `Compare & pull request` button which just became available in your forked repo.
    - Review the details of the pull request and when finished, click the `Send pull request` button.

Please follow the following guidelines when contributing:

- Categories should be listed *alphabetically* and should be present in the Table of Contents.
- List items should be sorted *alphabetically* within a category.
- Each item should be limited to one restaurant.
- The item should include the name of the restaurant as a link to a Google Maps Place and the appropriate symbol for relative price and a description.
  - Find the restaurant on Google Maps, then with the Place selected, click `Share` and copy the link.
- Descriptions should be clear, concise and representative of what to expect.
- Descriptions should follow the name, map and symbol, on the same line and end with a punctuation mark.
- An item should only be present in one category.
- At least 3 items are needed to create a new category.

Please only contribute restaurants you have eaten at. This will help ensure high-quality entries.


## Quality Standards

To be on the list, restaurants should adhere to these quality standards:

- The restaurant can be found at a permanent location.
- The restaurant conforms to cleanliness and heath safety standards.


## Maintainers

To make sure every PR is checked, we have a [team of maintainers](MAINTAINERS). Every PR MUST be reviewed by at least one maintainer before it can get merged. **Note: Please consider becoming a maintainer.**  

The maintainers will review your PR and notify you and tag it in case any information is still missing. They will wait 8 days for your interaction, after that the PR will be closed.


## Reporting Issues

Please open an issue if you would like to discuss anything that could be improved or have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource. We realize sometimes restaurants may need to be remove or updated, so if you see issues, feel free to change its listing or let us know.

Removal changes will not be applied until they have been pending for a minimum of 1 week (7 days). This grace window benefits restaurants that may be going through a temporary transition but are otherwise worthy of being on the list.

Thanks everyone!  Looking forward to your contribution.
